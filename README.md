# UNIVERSAL_VERIFICATION_METHOD
## Introduction
Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is a widely adopted verification methodology in the semiconductor industry for developing testbenches to verify digital hardware designs. UVM is based on the SystemVerilog language and provides a set of pre-defined classes, macros, and functions that implement common verification tasks. Its primary goal is to provide a standardized way of developing testbenches that are reusable, configurable, and scalable, while maintaining consistency and efficiency throughout the verification process. By using UVM, verification teams can reduce development time, improve verification quality, and ensure their designs meet the required functional and performance specifications. This repository provides an overview of the UVM methodology, its implementation of effective testbenches using different classes for digital hardware verification.
